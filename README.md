## About
Mandarina is a personal project that I worked on during the first half of 2020. It's an online multiplayer action game for PC, and it was made in C++ using a handful of relatively low-level libraries. The gameplay is heavily inspired by Brawl Stars, but includes elements of MOBAS and bullet hell games.

At the moment of writing this the project is in indefinite hold. Maybe some day I'll return to it. For now it has the following features
* Custom Client/Server multiplayer engine
* Two fully playable characters with four different abilities each
* One game mode for up to 8 players (free for all)
* A bush that makes characters invisible (similar to starcraft, LOL and many other games)
* Chests that spawn food that can be eaten to gain level and increase your character's power
* A storm that closes in on the map and forces players to move towards the center

The engine also supports many different types of abilities (like flash, invisiblity, ability-refresh, stuns, etc) and status changes (stun, slow, disarm and silence). Having said this, there's still many types of abilities that the engine doesn't support (like forced movement, for example) and that I wanted to work on to be able to add more characters. The project was at a very early stage of development and there's a lot of temporary code that was supposed to be improved at later stages.

The game has been tested and proven to work on a custom at-home server with up to 5 players online
